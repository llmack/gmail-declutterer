Goal: Build an app to help declutter gmail inbox and reduce memory footprint by deleting all old promotional, news, and other subscription email, while still providing enough control to ensure that nothing critical is deleted. 

Includes: 
- validate google account through google SSO
- access and manage email via gmail APIs
- Rules-based engine with editorial review and control, as well as configurable automation
