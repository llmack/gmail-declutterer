Gmail Declutter App - Product Requirements Document
TL;DR
Gmail Declutter helps engineers and power users drastically shrink Gmail clutter and storage by targeting subscriptions, newsletters, promotions, and outdated emails with user-defined, rule-based automation (no ML required). Seamless Google integration and clear, granular control ensure transparency and trust. The focus is on building a fast, low-friction MVP with concrete impact.

Goals
Business Goals
	•	Reduce personal and collective Gmail storage waste and associated costs.
	•	Demonstrate a pragmatic, fast-built MVP suitable for viral adoption, especially within the developer and Replit communities.
	•	Promote digital self-ownership and data control ("own your data").
	•	Provide a compelling technical showcase for Replit as a product build environment.
User Goals
	•	Minimize Gmail storage footprint with minimal manual effort.
	•	Automate regular inbox cleanup with full transparency and granular control.
	•	Enable users to preview, undo, and trust every automated decision.
	•	Maintain and protect all important emails, with safeguards and clear audit trails.
	•	Increase users' confidence and reduce digital anxiety caused by email clutter.
Non-Goals
	•	No implementation of machine learning or advanced AI in the MVP.
	•	No semantic—or content-based—analysis; focus solely on rules, metadata, and pattern matching.
	•	No support for non-Gmail email providers or platforms at launch.

User Stories
Power User / Engineer
	•	As an engineer, I want to see the current size and breakdown of my Gmail clutter, so I know where my storage is wasted.
	•	As an engineer, I want to write or tweak rules using regex, sender, or age parameters, so I have granular control.
	•	As an engineer, I want to preview what will be deleted, so I can prevent loss of important messages.
	•	As an engineer, I want to undo any batch cleanup, so I can recover from mistakes without worry.
Typical Gmail User Overwhelmed by Clutter
	•	As a user, I want to automate removing newsletters and promotional emails, so my inbox stays manageable.
	•	As a user, I want to schedule regular declutters, so email mess never piles up again.
	•	As a user, I want to review and approve deletions in advance, so I maintain trust in the process.
	•	As a user, I want to see summaries and stats after each cleanup, so I feel good about my progress.
	•	As a user, I want one-click restoration of mistakenly deleted messages, so I have complete peace of mind.

Functional Requirements
Email Management (High Priority)
	•	Secure Google Authentication: Use OAuth, request only the minimal Gmail API scopes and provide clear permission explanations.
	•	Efficient Email Scanning: Rapidly scan mailbox using rules based on metadata (date, sender/domain, subject patterns). Batch process for speed.
	•	Rule Editor: Allow users to create, edit, and delete rules (regex, sender, age, type). Provide a list of common, useful templates.
	•	Preview and Undo: Always provide a preview before deletion. Enable one-click batch undo for a defined recovery window (7 days).
User Control & Transparency (Medium Priority)
	•	Stats and Dashboard: Show storage usage, count of deleted emails, clutter by category, and history of actions.
	•	Scheduling: Allow users to schedule recurring cleanups (e.g., weekly, monthly).
	•	Exclusion and Exception Lists: Safe-list specific senders, domains, labels, or keywords from cleanup rules.
	•	Audit Log: Maintain a history of actions with clear, user-accessible reporting.
Learning, Export, and Growth (Low Priority)
	•	Adaptive Suggestions: Optionally log user recoveries to suggest refinements for future rule creation.
	•	Rule Export/Import: Users can export/import rules and settings for full portability.
	•	Future-Ready Architecture: Structured for future integrations beyond Gmail and advanced analytics, without bloat in MVP.

User Experience
Entry Point & First-Time User Experience
	•	Users discover Gmail Declutter via Replit, web search, or a colleague referral.
	•	On visiting, users see a clear value proposition and “Connect with Google” button.
	•	Upon clicking, a simple OAuth flow requests exactly the permissions needed, with transparent explanations.
	•	First load: Immediate dashboard shows bloat summary (storage used, types of emails, actionable recommendations).
Core Experience
	•	Step 1: Dashboard and Review
	◦	User sees at-a-glance stats: storage use, unread count, largest clutter sources.
	◦	Prominent call-to-action: “Set up Rules” or “Quick Clean.”
	•	Step 2: Rule Configuration
	◦	UI offers easy editing and toggling of built-in rules (e.g., "Delete newsletters older than 30 days").
	◦	Add/edit custom rules: by sender, keyword, age, or using regex.
	◦	Exception/exclude management: whitelist senders, domains, or labels.
	•	Step 3: Preview Changes
	◦	Preview interface lists emails matching each rule, grouped by category.
	◦	User can drill down, exclude items from deletion, or adjust rule parameters.
	◦	Option to simulate cleanup without deleting (simulate: “what would be removed?”).
	•	Step 4: Execution (“Run Now” or Schedule)
	◦	User confirms batch actions, sees a clear progress indicator.
	◦	Upon completion, dashboard shows summary: # of emails deleted, storage reclaimed, any items skipped for safety.
	•	Step 5: Undo/Restore (7-Day Window)
	◦	User can access the audit log, select batches or individual emails, and restore instantly.
	◦	Undo feedback highlights what was recovered and suggests refining active rules if too many restores occur.
Advanced Features & Edge Cases
	•	Allow for manual rule overrides for rare senders or edge cases.
	•	Soft deletion by moving messages to trash, not permanent delete.
	•	Proactive detection of Gmail API rate limits with user-friendly error/retry messaging.
UI/UX Highlights
	•	Minimalist, responsive layout for web and mobile.
	•	Clear onboarding, warnings, and visual previews.
	•	High contrast, accessible design; supports keyboard and screen reader navigation.
	•	Strong feedback and undo (“safety net”) mechanisms before and after every critical action.
	•	No hidden operations: show users what’s happening, always.

Narrative
Stacey, a senior engineer, dreads opening her Gmail and seeing over 60,000 unread emails—mostly old news, expired offers, and subscription updates she’s long since tuned out. She suspects this digital clutter is a huge storage sink and a persistent source of anxiety but lacks the time (or patience) for manual cleanup.
She finds Gmail Declutter through Replit. After a friendly, transparent authentication, the dashboard spits out a breakdown: half her storage lost to newsletters, a third to aged promotional mail. She sets up a quick rule—delete news older than two weeks, sweep up expired promotions, and safe-list her invoices label. The preview feature reassures her that nothing important will be lost. Confident, she runs the cleanup and instantly frees up 3GB.
The audit log later highlights one receipt that got swept up; Stacy restores it with a click. Impressed, she schedules monthly runs and feels a new sense of control and calm with her inbox. For Replit, this success story signals hacker-friendly, impactful software—fueling viral buzz in the dev community.

Technical Considerations
Technical Needs
	•	Gmail API integration (minimal, focused scopes for reading, modifying, and labeling emails).
	•	Session caching of email metadata to minimize repeated API calls.
	•	Batch processing logic to operate efficiently on large mailbox datasets.
	•	Onboard UI for rule creation, preview, and undo actions.
Integration Points
	•	Google OAuth for authentication and permissions.
	•	Replit hosting/deployment (potential for featured plugin support).
Data Storage & Privacy
	•	Never persist email content; only store metadata, rules, and action logs locally or securely in user session.
	•	Full user controls and export/delete options for any persistent metadata or rules.
	•	Compliance with applicable data privacy regulations; clear, accessible documentation of data use.
Scalability & Performance
	•	Designed to operate fast on large mailboxes (100,000+ emails), using Gmail API batch endpoints.
	•	Exponential backoff/retry logic to handle Google API rate limits gracefully.
	•	No performance dependence on email size/content (metadata only).
Potential Challenges
	•	Navigating Gmail API quotas and rate limit responses.
	•	Ensuring atomicity and correctness in batch deletes/restores.
	•	Sustaining user trust—nothing is deleted without user preview and approval.

Milestones & Sequencing
Project Estimate
	•	Small: 1–2 weeks for full MVP.
Team Size & Composition
	•	1–2 engineers (ideally full stack, with product/design empathy).
